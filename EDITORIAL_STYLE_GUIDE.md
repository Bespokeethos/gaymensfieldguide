# Editorial Style Manual: Content and Style Directive

---

## 1.0 Principle of Clarity

**Mandate:** All content must be unambiguous and instantly comprehensible to the target audience.

- **1.1 Language:** Employ precise, literal language. Avoid metaphor, simile, and other forms of figurative speech that may introduce interpretive ambiguity.
- **1.2 Sentence Structure:** Construct sentences to be direct and logically sound. The standard structure should be Subject-Verb-Object. Complex or compound sentences must be divisible into discrete, verifiable statements.
- **1.3 Objective:** The primary goal of any text is efficient knowledge transfer. Clarity is the vehicle for this transfer.

## 2.0 Principle of Precision

**Mandate:** All statements presented as fact must be verifiable and accurate.

- **2.1 Factual Accuracy:** Assertions, data points, and technical specifications must be cross-referenced against authoritative sources.
- **2.2 Quantifiable Data:** Prefer quantitative descriptions over qualitative ones. For example, specify "a 400,000-token context window" instead of "a large memory."
- **2.3 Source Attribution:** All external data or claims must be attributed to their original source via citation.

## 3.0 Principle of Structure

**Mandate:** Content must be organized logically to facilitate scanning and comprehension.

- **3.1 Headings:** Utilize a hierarchical heading structure (H1, H2, H3) to delineate thematic sections.
- **3.2 Bullet Points and Lists:** Employ bulleted or numbered lists to enumerate items, steps, or key points. This enhances readability and breaks down complex information.
- **3.3 Paragraphs:** Each paragraph must address a single, cohesive idea.

## 4.0 Principle of Terminology

**Mandate:** Vocabulary must be professional, consistent, and standardized.

- **4.1 Professional Vocabulary:** Use industry-standard terminology.
- **4.2 Consistency:** A term used for a specific concept must be used consistently throughout all content.
- **4.3 Glossary:** A central glossary of approved terms shall be maintained. Avoid the creation of nonce terms or jargon.

## 5.0 Principle of Outcome-Oriented Content

**Mandate:** Every piece of content must be created to achieve a specific, measurable objective.

- **5.1 Measurable Goals:** Define the intended outcome before content creation. Examples: "To inform the user of a new feature's technical specifications," or "To guide the user through a specific workflow."
- **5.2 Call to Action:** If the objective requires user action, a clear and direct call to action must be included.

## 6.0 Principle of Tone

**Mandate:** The tone shall be objective, authoritative, and impartial.

- **6.1 Objectivity:** Present information without emotion, speculation, or personal opinion.
- **6.2 Authority:** The voice should be confident and knowledgeable, grounded in the principles of precision and clarity.
- **6.3 Pronouns:** Avoid the use of first-person (I, we) and second-person (you) pronouns. The content should speak from an institutional voice.

## 7.0 Principle of Format

**Mandate:** A consistent templating system must be applied to all content of the same type.

- **7.1 Consistent Template:** All articles, reports, and updates will follow a pre-defined structural template.
- **7.2 Concise Sentences:** Sentences should be brief and to the point. The ideal sentence length is 15-20 words.
- **7.3 White Space:** Use paragraphs, lists, and headings to create a clean, uncluttered visual presentation.

## 8.0 Principle of Content Efficiency

**Mandate:** Content must be maximally efficient, conveying the most information with the fewest possible words.

- **8.1 Avoid Redundancy:** Do not repeat information unless necessary for emphasis, in which case it should be explicitly framed as such.
- **8.2 Eliminate Jargon:** Avoid domain-specific jargon that is not defined in the glossary or essential to the topic. If jargon is necessary, it must be defined upon first use.
- **8.3 Keyword Optimization:** Keywords should be selected based on relevance and search value, used naturally within the content, not "stuffed." Limit to essential terms only.
